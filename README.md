# Differential equation assignment

### What is it?
Web application that plots graphs of numerical solutions to first-order differential equation. Implemented methods:
* Euler
* Improved Euler
* Runge-Kutta

Also, there are graphs of local and total approximation error for this solution and possibilities to change the equation, initial conditions and the step of graph.
